# Fake News Classifier

Project for CSE 4308 Artificial Intelligence course by:
1. Nihar Gupte
2. Hemantha Govindu




### Problem to be solved

With the advent of social media and the upcoming US presidential elections, Fake News holds a vital position in todayâ€™s world as it has the ability to have damaging impacts on an individual or a group, along with widespread false information. Hence, the attention on the detection of fake news has become more important than ever, from researchers to politicians.


In this project, Nihar Gupte(Student ID #1001556441) and I, will be building a Fake News Detector, which will help differentiate between real and fake news stories. We plan to use a few natural language processing as well as machine learning algorithms as a way to help people determine the legitimacy of a news article. It will also let the user know the basis on which the article was classified as real or fake.

We will be using the following to help us achieve our goal: <br>
Passive Aggressive algorithms [4] <br>
Naive Bayes Classifiers [1][7][8] <br>
Logistic Regression Classifier [1] <br>
TFIDF features (Term frequency inverse frequency) [4] <br>

Python libraries: <br>
numpy <br>
pandas <br>
sklearn <br>
tkinter <br>
